This repository contains my work for the **WDD 430: Web Full-Stack Development** course at BYU-Idaho.  
It focuses on foundational JavaScript and React concepts using the official [Next.js React Foundations Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations).

## 📚 Course Resource

All learning materials and tutorials come from the official Next.js documentation:  
➡️ [React Foundations – Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)

## 📌 Chapters Completed

These are the chapters I’ve completed so far as part of this learning activity:

1. **About React and Next.js**  
2. **Rendering User Interfaces (UI)**  
3. **Updating UI with JavaScript**  
4. **Getting Started with React**  
5. **Building UI with Components**  
6. **Displaying Data with Props**

## 📝 Purpose

This is a professional learning activity designed to simulate real-world developer onboarding. The goal is to:
